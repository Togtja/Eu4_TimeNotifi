# Eu4_TimeNotifi

A notification system for the Paradox game Europa Universalis 4

## What do I do

I read EU4 memory to find the date in memory. Then keep track of the date, and allow people to add notifications to a given date. Currently I only support audio clues, meaning a sound will be played when the user-set date hits.

## How to use

TODO: Complete and add images where missing

When you this software, you should be greeted with a screen like this one: (Insert Image here)[] 

Here you have a few options, but to keep it simple, the "submit" button is the only important one. However, we need to start the actual game (Eu4) before I can do anything useful. Once Eu4 is booted, and a save is loaded/started, enter the current date of the game into here (Another image here)[]. 

Then a search of that date will happen, this will take 2-5 seconds depending on your hardware. Once the date has been found, you will most likely be greeted with a message saying enter another date (Yet another image here)[]. If so you should just need to un-pause the game and let the date tick one day, and enter that date into the Eu4-Notifi application. Once this is done the Eu4-Notifi should look like this: (More Images)[].

Now you can use this (Image)[] to add notification that plays when that date is reached
